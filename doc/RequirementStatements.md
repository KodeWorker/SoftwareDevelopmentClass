# Requirement Statements
This is an example case of intelligent manufacturing system.

# Virtual Metrology System Developement
- Machine generates one workpiece in each run. Sensor data was collected during the manufacturing process.
- Sensor data contains not only numerical, but also ordinal (mixed type) data. Data should be deidentified.
- The program reads the sensor data (and historical data) to predict the future workpiece quality.
- The prediction time is constrained by the process time.
- The program will show warning when the predicted quality is out of the given limits.
